- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hocuscadabra
- 👀 I’m interested in the intersections of responsible AI with the legal, compliance, cybersecurity and privacy/data regulations.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of Python (who knew BASIC and DOS could be useful decades later 🤔) so I can better work with AI to solve problems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on newby tolerant projects where my IT law, compliance, marketing law, cybersecurity reg knowledge, privacy/data regulations skills could be useful and in exchange I'd get to learn.
